Select whether this product will communicate with the wireless network in Ad hoc mode or in Infrastructure mode.<br>When using an Access Point:<br>Select "Infrastructure". This product will communicate with a network device via the Access Point which has the same SSID as this product. <br>When not using an Access Point:<br>Select "Ad hoc". This product will directly communicate with a network device which has the same SSID as this product. <br>*When using this product in Ad hoc mode, the wireless standard is limited to "IEEE802.11b", and the network authentication mode is limited to "Open" or "Shared".
Enter the SSID (up to 32 alphanumeric characters) of the wireless network to be used with this product. <br>The SSID is the ID that identifies the wireless network. Wireless devices need to have the same SSID when they communicate with each other in a wireless LAN network.
Select the communication channel to be used by this product in the wireless LAN. <br>Set the channel only when using this product in Ad hoc mode.
