.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dhcpcd
is an implementation of the DHCP client specified in
.B RFC2131
(when -r option is not specified) and
.B RFC1541
(when -r option is specified).  Support for
.B draft-ietf-dhc-fqdn-option
in use in many systems (particularly networks using Microsoft DHCP
servers) is also provided.

It gets the host information (IP address, netmask, broadcast address,
etc.) from a DHCP server and configures the network interface of the
machine on which it is running. It also tries to renew the lease time
according to
.B RFC2131
or
.B RFC1541
(obsolete).


.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-d
With this flag
.B dhcpcd
will
syslog(LOG_DEBUG,...) messages for about every step it does.
It's recommended to use this option since it doesn't really
produce too much output but will greatly help in resolving
a problems if any.
.B dhcpcd
uses
.I LOCAL0
syslog facility for its output. To catch
.B dhcpcd
debugging output add the following line to
.I /etc/syslog.conf
file:

local0.*     /var/log/dhcpcd.log

and then refresh syslogd daemon:

kill -1 `cat /var/run/syslogd.pid`

.TP
.BI \-k
Sends
.B SIGHUP
signal to the
.B dhcpcd
process associated with the specified interface if one is currently running. If
.B dhcpcd
receives
.B SIGHUP
it will send
.B DCHP_RELEASE
message to the server and destroy dhcpcd cache. In a case
.B dhcpcd
receives
.B SIGTERM
which is normally used by
.B shutdown(8)
when rebooting the system
.B dhcpcd
will not send
.B DHCP_RELEASE
and will not destroy cache. When system boots
.B dhcpcd
will use cache to request the same IP address
from DHCP server which was assigned before the
system went down. (see also
.B -p
)
.TP
.BI \-m \ <routeMetric>
routes will be added with the given metric. The default is 0.
.TP
.BI \-n
Sends
.B SIGALRM
signal to the
.B dhcpcd
process that is currently running which
forces
.B dhcpcd
to try to renew the lease. If dhcpcd is not running, the flag
is ignored and
.B dhcpcd
follows the normal startup procedure.
.TP
.BI \-o
Stops
.B dhcpcd
from bringing the interface down when it is terminated with the
.B SIGTERM
signal. This is useful when the interace is controlled by another daemon
such as
.B ifplugd
or
.B wpa_supplicant
and the daemon requires the interface to remain up.
.TP
.BI \-p
Stops
.B dhcpcd
from bringing the interface down when it is terminated with the
.B SIGTERM
signal. This is useful when a host is running with an NFS-mounted root
filesystem over an interface controlled by DHCP. It should not be used
except in those circumstances, since if 
.B dhcp
is stopped it can no longer down an interface at the end of its
lease period when the lease is not renewed.
Unlike the 
.B \-o
option, the address remains on the interface.
.TP
.BI \-r
Makes dhcpcd RFC1541 (obsolete) compliant.
.B dhcpcd
is RFC2131 compliant unless this option is specified.
.TP
.BI \-B
Requests broadcast response from DHCP server.
.TP
.BI \-C
Forces dhcpcd to calculate checksum on received packets.
.TP
.BI \-D
Forces
.B dhcpcd
to set domainname of the host to the domainname option
supplied by DHCP server.
.TP
.BI \-F \ none|ptr|both
Forces
.B dhcpcd
to request the DHCP server update the DNS using the FQDN option
instead of the Hostname option. The name used by this option
is specified with the \fB-h\fP switch, which must be present. If
the \fB-h\fP switch is not present, the FQDN option is ignored.
The name should be fully qualified, although servers usually
accept a simple name.
.I both
requests that the DHCP server update both the A and PTR
records in the DNS.
.I ptr
requests that the DHCP server updates only the PTR record in
the DNS.
.I none
requests that the DHCP server perform no updates.
.B dhcpcd
does not perform any DNS update, even when the server is
requested to perform no updates.  This can be easily
implemented outside the client; all the necessary
information is recorded in the
.I <ConfigDir>/dhcpcd-<interface>.info
file.
.TP
.BI \-H
Forces
.B dhcpcd
to set hostname of the host to the hostname option supplied by DHCP server.
By default
.B dhcpcd
will NOT set hostname of the host to the hostname option
received from DHCP server.
.TP
.BI \-L \ <ConfigDir>
.B dhcpcd
will use
.I <ConfigDir>
directory instead of default
.I /etc/dhcpc
to store configuration information.
.TP
.BI \-S
Forces
.B dhcpcd
to send second DHCP_DISCOVER message even
after receiving DHCP_OFFER on the first one. Some DHCP servers
expect the client to send second DHCP_DISCOVER message
before replying on DHCP_REQUEST.
.TP
.BI \-R
Prevents
.B dhcpcd
from replacing existing
.I <etcDir>/resolv.conf
file.
.TP
.BI \-Y
Prevents
.B dhcpcd
from replacing existing
.I <etcDir>/yp.conf
file. Domainname is not updated unless \fB-D\fP is specified.
.TP
.BI \-N
Prevents
.B dhcpcd
from replacing existing
.I <etcDir>/ntp.conf
file.
.TP
.BI \-T
Test case, when
.B dhcpcd
goes through the DHCP negotiation sequence but
doesn't actually configure the interface. It does however
write the
.I <ConfigDir>/dhcpcd-<interface>.info
and
.I <ConfigDir>/dhcpcd-<interface>.cache
files and it does attempt to execute the script defined by the
.I \-c \ <ExecFilePath>
option.
.B \-T
option is used primarily for testing DHCP servers,
for obtaining multiple IP addresses for the same dummy interface, and/or
configuring virtual interfaces in conjunction with
.I \-L \ <ConfigDir>
and
.I \-I \ <ClientID>
options.
.TP
.BI \-t \ <timeout>
Specifies (in seconds ) for how long
.B dhcpcd
will try to get an IP address. The default is 60 seconds.
.B dhcpcd
will not fork into background until it gets a valid IP address
in which case dhcpcd will return 0 to the parent process.
In a case
.B dhcpcd
times out before receiving a valid IP address from DHCP server
.B dhcpcd
will return exit code 1 to the parent process. Setting the timeout to
zero disables it: dhcp will keep trying forever to get a lease, and if
the lease is lost, it will try forever to get another.
.TP
.BI \-c \ <ExecFilePath>
.B dhcpcd
will try to execute
.I <ExecFilePath>
script instead of default
.I /etc/dhcpc/dhcpcd.exe
script every time it configures or brings down the interface. See the
description of
.I dhcpcd.exe
script in
.B FILES
section below.
.TP
.BI \-h \ <hostname>
specifies a string used for the hostname option field when
.B dhcpcd
sends DHCP messages. Some DHCP servers, notably those used by
@Home Networks, require the hostname option
field containing a specific string in the DHCP messages from clients.
When combined with the -F switch, specifies the string used for the
FQDN option field instead of the hostname option field.
.TP
.BI \-i \ <vendorClassID>
Specifies the vendor class identifier string.
.B dhcpcd
uses the default vendor class identifier string (system name, system release,
and machine type) if it is not specified.
.TP
.BI \-I \ <ClientID>
Specifies the client identifier string.
.B dhcpcd
uses the default client identifier (MAC address of the network
interface) if it is not specified.
.TP
.BI \-l \ <leasetime>
Specifies (in seconds) the recommended lease time to the server. (Note
that the server can override this value if it sees fit). This value is
used in the
.B DHCP_DISCOVER
message. The default is infinite (0xffffffff).
.TP
.BI \-s \ [ipaddr]
Sends DHCP_INFORM message to DHCP server using ipaddr. 
The optional ipaddr parameter must be in
the form xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx.
If no ipaddr parameter is given on the command line
.B dhcpcd
will use the IP address currently assigned to the interface.
If there is no IP address currently assigned
to the interface
.B dhcpcd
will use previously obtained IP address stored in
.I <ConfigDir>/dhcpcd-<interface>.cache
file. 
.TP
.BI \-G \ [gateway]
Prevents
.B dhcpcd
from installing default routes provided by DHCP server.
If optional gateway ip address parameter
is supplied then use it for default route.
.TP
.BI \-w \ <windowsize>
Specifies the window size for the gateway route. Default = 32768.
.TP
.BI \-e \ <etcDir>
Specifies where
.B dhcpcd
should create resolv.conf, ntp.conf and yp.conf. Default is the /etc
directory.
.TP
.BI interface
Specifies the network interface name (eth0, eth1, etc.).
.TP
.B dhcpcd
uses the network interface
.I eth0
unless an explicit name is specified.

.SH FILES
.PD 0
.TP
.BI /etc/dhcpc
Default 
.I <ConfigDir>
directory used for storing files
created by
.B dhcpcd.
See option
.I \-L <ConfigDir>
above.
.PD 1
.TP
.BI <ConfigDir>/dhcpcd-<interface>.info
file in which
.B dhcpcd
saves the host information. The word
.I <interface>
is actually replaced with the network interface name like
.I eth0
to which dhcpcd is attached.
.TP
.BI /etc/dhcpc/dhcpcd.exe
script file, which
.B dhcpcd
will try to execute whenever it configures or brings down the interface. The
path to this executable script can be changed with
.I \-c \ <ExecFilePath>
option.
.B Dhcpcd
passes 3 parameters to
.I dhcpcd.exe
script:
.TP
.I dhcpcd.exe <HostInfoFilePath> <up|down|new> [-d]
The first parameter
.I <HostInfoFilePath>
is path to
.I dhcpcd-<interface>.info
file. The word
.I <interface>
is actually replaced with interface name dhcpcd is
attached to, e.g. "eth0". The second parameter values
.I <up|down|new>
mean the interface has been brought up with the same IP address as before ("up"), or
with the new IP address ("new"), or the interface has been brought down ("down"). Parameter
.I -d
is passed in a case
.B dhcpcd
has been started with
.I -d
debug flag.
.TP
.BI <ConfigDir>/dhcpcd-<interface>.cache
Cache file containing the previously assigned IP address and
some other things.
The word
.I <interface>
is actually replaced with the network interface name like
.I eth0
to which
.B dhcpcd
is attached.
.TP
.BI <etcDir>/resolv.conf
file created by
.B dhcpcd
when the client receives DNS and domain name options.
The old
.B <etcDir>/resolv.conf
file is renamed to
.B <etcDir>/resolv.conf.sv
and will be restored back when
.B dhcpcd
exits for any reason.
.TP
.BI <etcDir>/yp.conf
file created by
.B dhcpcd
when the client receives NIS options.
The old
.B <etcDir>/yp.conf
file is renamed to
.B <etcDir>/yp.conf.sv
and is restored back when
.B dhcpcd
exits for any reason.
.TP
.BI <etcDir>/ntp.conf
file created by
.B dhcpcd
when the client receives NTP options.
The old
.B <etcDir>/ntp.conf
file is renamed to
.B <etcDir>/ntp.conf.sv
and is restored back when
.B dhcpcd
exits for any reason.
.TP
.BI /etc/dhcpcd-<interface>.pid
file containing the process id of
.B dhcpcd.
The word
.I <interface>
is actually replaced with the network interface name like
.I eth0
to which
.B dhcpcd
is attached.

.SH BUGS
.PD 0
.B dhcpcd
uses
.B time(3)
to calculate the lease expiration time.  If the system time is changed
while the client is running, the lease expiration time may not be
predictable.
